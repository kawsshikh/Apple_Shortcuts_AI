**üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
This Shortcut acts as a clever intermediary:

You activate the Shortcut via Siri (e.g., "Hey Siri, Be Smart").
Your voice input is captured by the Shortcut.
The Shortcut constructs an HTTP POST request containing your spoken query.
This request is sent to the Google Gemini API endpoint.
Gemini processes your query and returns a JSON response.
The Shortcut parses this JSON, extracts Gemini's answer, and can display it as text or even speak it back to you!
